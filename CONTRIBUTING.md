# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the changes you wish to make via an issue. If an issue for the changes you intend to make does not exist, create one.

## General contributing workflow
1. Raise an issue for the changes you wish to make (or start working on a pre-existing issue).
2. Make a branch for your changes. Base it on the master branch.
3. Do all editing and testing on the issue-specific branch. Commit only to that branch, do not edit the master branch directly.
4. Once you have something working, make sure it has the appropriate [documentation](./instructions/generating_documentation.md), and [tests](./instructions/testing.md)
5. Create a pull request to merge your branch into the master. In it, summarize your changes. Assign a reviewer / reviewers for the pull request.
