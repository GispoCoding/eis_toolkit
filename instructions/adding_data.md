# Adding data
## File structure
All data should be stored under `tests/data/`. Here you have two subdirectories for storing data:
- `tests/data/remote/` to host data that should be pushed to remote. Don't add anything here unless you specifically need it on the remote. Also, filesizes matter here - favour small files.
- `tests/data/local/` to host data that should be ignored by git (i.e. not pushed to the remote). Good for closed data or large files. Use this by default for storing any data.

The `tests/data/local/` directory is split to two subdirectories as well:
- `tests/data/local/data/` to host the input data for testing. If you have access to EIS-specific testing data, extract it here.
- `tests/data/local/results/` to host all files generated by testing.

Here's an example of what the file structure looks like:
```
tests/data
├── local
│   ├── data
│   │   ├── <a copy of the EIS testing data folder>
│   │   └── <any other data for testing>
│   └── results
│       └── <files generated by testing>
└── remote
    └── <data on remote>
```
