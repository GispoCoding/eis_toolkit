**What does the tool do?**
Please describe what the tool does. Ex. "This tool calculates distances to known deposits"

**Why is the tool needed?**
Please give reasoning why the tool is needed. Is the tool essential or a nice-to-have? 

**Which category do you think the tool belongs to?** 
The current categories are the directories under `eis_toolkit` package in this repository. You may also suggest a new category if a suitable one doesn't exist.

**Implementation details**
What does the tool take as input and what is its output? Ex. "The tool takes raster data as input and outputs decimal numbers as an array". Is there a ready made library that already contains the desired functionality or should it be implemented from scratch? Is the library already part of EIS toolkit?

**Who will implement the tool?**
Are you ready to implement the tool yourself or will you hope someone else to do it?

**Additional information**
Any additional information e.g. usage examples, screenshots, links to scientific studies and other documents.
